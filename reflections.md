#Today I - 

* Set up my Github account
* Installed Zotero and Zotero chrome plugin
* Hypothesis was already installed - I joined the group for the Drafting DH course
* Tested Zotero while browsing my regular news websites - very easy to save pages to read later or refer back to
* I reviewed some Github Markdown instructions so I can start using that to style my notes properly
* Built a sample help post, using markdown formatting to clearly show the problem
* Read the articles on Returning Women to the History of Digital History and History Can Be Open Source
