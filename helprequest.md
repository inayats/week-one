# Error while trying to commit folder

Hi folks, I am trying to commit changes to a folder from the terminal in my Mac.

I opened the folder in Finder and launched the terminal from it.

I tried this command:

`git commit -m "this is just a test"`

Got back this error:
`fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git`

Any idea what might be happening here? Thanks for the help!
